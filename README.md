# TTS-Mod-Backups

This is a Personal Archive I made to backup Mods I use and ones I want to keep a backup of.

Most mods are on the Steam Workshop, but the way TTS works allot of them over time go bad do to
there files being deleted off the server there hosted on.

Nothing in these files was editied these are all the files used in that mod on the Workshop, so
all credit for the mod unless noted goes to the Mod Author on the Steam Workshop.

You will need TTS Mod Backup to use these mods archives the right way you can get the latest version here if you already don't have it.  https://www.nexusmods.com/tabletopsimulator/mods/263

I will add more mods to the Archive over time, right now I have just uploaded Some of the Smaller ones.

If you know of a Mod you think I should add and have a good Archive of it let me know and I will add it to the list.
